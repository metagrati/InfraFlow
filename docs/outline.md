# InfraFlow Documentation Outline

## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 What is InfraFlow?
- Overview of InfraFlow as a DSL for infrastructure automation.
- Comparison with traditional Ansible playbooks.
- Key benefits: conciseness, structure, readability, and automation.

### 1.2 Why Use InfraFlow?
- Reducing verbosity in infrastructure-as-code.
- Simplifying Kubernetes automation.
- Enhancing automation workflow with a declarative approach.

## 2. Getting Started
### 2.1 Installation
- Cloning the repository.
- Installing dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).

### 2.2 Basic Workflow
- Writing an InfraFlow YAML file.
- Converting it into an Ansible playbook (`dsl_to_ansible.py`).
- Executing the generated playbook with Ansible.

### 2.3 Example DSL File
- Walkthrough of a simple InfraFlow YAML file.
